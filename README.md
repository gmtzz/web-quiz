# Process for App Deployment
For Javascript quiz I used Javascript to make dynamic changes to the corresponding HTML document. 
# How does it work?
First the app is displayed in an HTML document that has the purpose of quizzing the user from a range of questions. 
* Once the user navigates to the "Start Quiz" button, they are prompted answer Javascript questions.
* The user is given three questions, the user has to answer each question to the best of their ability from the displayed options. 
*  Ideally, the timer would subtract extra seconds if the user chose an incorrect option to each question. 
* Ideally, at the end of the quiz they would be prompted to enter their initials and be prompted to push the "high scores" button.
* Ideally, the high score button would showcase the users that completed the quiz from highest to lowest score.
