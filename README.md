# Web-Quiz
# Description 
This Javascript Quiz is made to quiz the user on Javascript questions, the users selects an answer from a range of questions. The user is timed for 5 minutes. Ideally, if the user inputs a wrong answer, the timer is subtracted time. When the user finishes the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their initials. After they input their initials, they are prompted to click the "High scores" button which will display the initials of the users that finished the quiz from highest to lowest score. 
# Process for App Deployment
For Javascript quiz I used Javascript to make dynamic changes to the corresponding HTML document. 
# How does it work?
First the app is displayed in an HTML document that has the purpose of quizzing the user from a range of questions. 
* Once the user navigates to the "Start Quiz" button, they are prompted answer Javascript questions.
* The user is given three questions, the user has to answer each question to the best of their ability from the displayed options. 
*  Ideally, the timer would subtract extra seconds if the user chose an incorrect option to each question. 
* Ideally, at the end of the quiz they would be prompted to enter their initials and be prompted to push the "high scores" button.
* Ideally, the high score button would showcase the users that completed the quiz from highest to lowest score.
